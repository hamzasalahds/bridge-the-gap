Project Overview
This project examines how high childcare costs limit mothers’ participation and advancement in professional employment in the U.S. Using data from 2008–2018, it analyzes regional disparities in childcare affordability and its economic impact on women’s workforce outcomes.

Key Insights
Childcare costs rose about 15% nationally, disproportionately affecting mothers’ employment rates.

Women’s median earnings remain significantly lower than men’s, with mothers concentrated in lower-paying jobs.

High childcare costs correlate with decreased workforce participation among mothers.

Recommendations
Expand subsidized childcare programs, especially in high-cost areas.

Encourage employer-supported childcare solutions.

Invest in career training programs to support upward mobility for mothers.

Tools & Methods
Data cleaning and analysis with Excel and Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Visualizations and dashboards created in Tableau

Statistical methods include correlation and comparative analysis

Ethical Note
All data is aggregated and anonymized to protect privacy. The analysis considers gender and racial equity throughout.
